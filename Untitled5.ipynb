            "I was in Tokyo with my son on his Make a Wish trip in the summer of 2019, and I accidentally walked off the train with my purse left on the seat and by the time I realized what happened, the train has left. We were told to call the lost and found the next morning, but I had no hope. In The states my purse would have been stolen almost instantly. When my kiddo and I made it back to our hotel, I remembered that my cell phone has a tracker on it, so we logged on and saw that my purse was still on the train, traveling the circular route that makes up the central Tokyo line. It circled for HOURS until the signal finally went off. The next morning we called lost and found and they had it! No one touched a cent in my wallet, our passports, credit cards and cash were all untouched. I was so struck by the civic responsibility that the entire population seems to adhere to. Loved Tokyo for many reasons, but this was such an amazing thing to experience.\n",

Parents and schools have to teach children at a very young age already how things are done, even the classroom-/school-cleaning should be done all over the world for people to learn to keep the city clean, but in the US all those Karens would protest and sue schools for making their children clean something that has to be done by some cleaning service, not by their precious poor little children... so the children just learn to be bitches about everything and become future Karens. Im happy I dont live in the US but Im also not happy anymore living in europe as in the past 10~ish years everything became more dirty and criminal in here, so Im more and more jealous about how well things work in Japan. Yes, it might be or seem racist to keep people out of your country but if this is the outcome... everyone that has been raised and grew up somewhere will treasure that place more than some new place they move to, they will know  and more likely follow the rules and how things are being done wherever they grew up, so anyone who was not raised or grew up at some place but moves there sometime later will do things the way they always did back home. People dont want to change or follow some new rules when being older, theyre too lazy.

Yes, it might be or seem racist to keep people out of your country but if this is the outcome... everyone that has been raised and grew up somewhere will treasure that place more than some new place they move to, they will know  and more likely follow the rules and how things are being done wherever they grew up, so anyone who was not raised or grew up at some place but moves there sometime later will do things the way they always did back home. People dont want to change or follow some new rules when being older, theyre too lazy. Just my 2 cents, you dont have to agree but surely if just anyone could easily move to Japan, you can guess the outcome...\n",

            "Japan literally copied their culture from China. When China discovered Japan, it was starving tribal nation, so Chinese taught them how to grow rice to feed themselves, how to cultivate silk for their clothing, and even how to read and write Chinese characters (Hanzi 汉字which they call Kanji), calligraphy and poetry. They learned how to use chopsticks, build Chinese architecture, how to govern themselves, how to create bonzai, etc, from China. \n",

Now that America is powerful, Japan started copying English words like aidoru (idol), aisu (ice-cream), anime (anime), apato (apartment), arukoru (alcohol), baiku (bike), basu (bus), biru (beer) kohi (coffee), chiketto (ticket), konpyuta (computer), doraiba (driver), erebeta (elevator), faito (fight), and so many more English words.\n",

            "Relations between ancient Japan and China have a long history, and in certain periods the exchange of political, religious and cultural practices between the two was intense. China, the much older state and the more developed, passed on to Japan (sometimes indirectly via Korea) a long list of ideas including rice cultivation, writing, Buddhism, centralised government models, civil service examinations, temple architecture, clothing, art, literature, music, and eating habits. Trade relations greatly outlasted cultural and diplomatic ties, with Japan beginning to develop its own unique cultural path from the 9th century CE onwards.\n",

            "Gordon Graham  :  1  :   @Kindle44  I teach at Tokyo University of Agriculture's Third High School in Saitama and have done so for 30 years.  I'm a full-time licensed teacher not an ALT.  I have a pretty decent remuneration package.  I also run an elite youth ice hockey program, Samurai Japan AAA Ice Hockey Club. So,  I'm in no need of government funding for stating my opinion which I do of my own volition.   In my 30 years, what I've found is that foreigners like myself, white and POC alike who have settled down and have had families and made a fulfilling life here rarely spend time on the Internet talking about it, because they are immersed in their lives.

As I've said, Sakura, that black Japanese girl in the Nike ad is a friend of my son.  Her life is nothing like the one depicted in the commercial.  She's a very popular girl with a lot of friends.  I also run a youth ice hockey program here.  We have 70 kids, including bi-national and bi-racial kids, from the Philippines, Sweden, Russia, the US, China and Nigeria.  All of those kids' families and the kids themselves have been welcomed with open arms and are considered part of the group, the family.  Certainly, kids are curious and ask about their backgrounds etc. but soon enough, they're all just another kid, the same.  That's the way it's been for my kids, that's the way it is for their kids.  The issues come when an \"us vs them\" dichotomy framework is set up in the home.  Many people accuse \"the Japanese\" of this, however when you think of the accusation \"the Japanese\"...\"they\"...\"them\".  Well, that's an illustration of an \"us and them\" dichotomy.

I also run a youth ice hockey program here.  We have 70 kids, including bi-national and bi-racial kids, from the Philippines, Sweden, Russia, the US, China and Nigeria.  All of those kids' families and the kids themselves have been welcomed with open arms and are considered part of the group, the family.  Certainly, kids are curious and ask about their backgrounds etc. but soon enough, they're all just another kid, the same.  That's the way it's been for my kids, that's the way it is for their kids.  The issues come when an \"us vs them\" dichotomy framework is set up in the home.  Many people accuse \"the Japanese\" of this, however when you think of the accusation \"the Japanese\"...\"they\"...\"them\".  Well, that's an illustration of an \"us and them\" dichotomy.  Most people don't see the irony in this.\n",

I clearly remember the schoolyard in the 1970s when kids from Pakistan would literally get the crap kicked out of them...for being Pakistani.  I boxed at a club called Cabbagetown Boxing Club.  There was a kid  in the club called Asif Dar.  He was from Pakistan.  His father made him take up boxing because he was getting the crap kicked out of him...every day!  In 30 years in Japan, I've never heard of such a thing.  There are neighborhoods in Toronto that are run by Jamaican gangs, others run by Vietnamese gangs, being an \"outsider\" in those neighborhoods, especially a white outsider means you are definitely in danger of being robbed or beaten.  I came to Japan after graduating summa cum laude, in the top 2% of my graduating year and with two academic awards to my name.  Despite this, I was told at my interview for the education program (the only way to get a teaching license in Canada...my modest goal, which I worked very hard for)...I was told \"we aren't currently accepting white males\".

            "Gordon Graham  :  2  :   @K  There is plenty of racism in Canada.  Cops not searching for indigenous girls gone missing is a prime example.  I clearly remember the schoolyard in the 1970s when kids from Pakistan would literally get the crap kicked out of them...for being Pakistani.  I boxed at a club called Cabbagetown Boxing Club.  There was a kid  in the club called Asif Dar.  He was from Pakistan.  His father made him take up boxing because he was getting the crap kicked out of him...every day!  In 30 years in Japan, I've never heard of such a thing.  There are neighborhoods in Toronto that are run by Jamaican gangs, others run by Vietnamese gangs, being an \"outsider\" in those neighborhoods, especially a white outsider means you are definitely in danger of being robbed or beaten.  I came to Japan after graduating summa cum laude, in the top 2% of my graduating year and with two academic awards to my name.  Despite this, I was told at my interview for the education program (the only way to get a teaching license in Canada...my modest goal, which I worked very hard for)...I was told \"we aren't currently accepting white males\".

Universal health care, including medicine AND dental, world class education (free for those who can't afford it), safe, clean streets...and more are reasons why Japan is an ideal country in which to raise a family.  Moving to Japan from Canada 30 years ago was the best decision I've ever made!\n",

As for your credulity...  you can click on my face to see a video of my hockey club and you can find me if you write my full name and Japan next to it.  Yes, no country is perfect, that's certain.  Japan is a wonderful country with wonderful people...in my experience.  I work at Tokyo University of Agriculture's Third High School...and have for 30 years.\n",

            "Now using military force is in a way imposing your subjective view of human rights to another country, to me it is \"negative\" stating that the human right creator's view is better than another country point of view of human rights. I believe in difference, respect of opinions, and love. i don't caution imposing your will on to another, forcing another to do what you want is rooted in egotistical approaches. This goes against the human right(according to my subjective view) anyone's opinion should have the right to be respected, and if they are using force in the name of human rights, it is destroying the adversity's right to have an opinion, so they are in a paradox praising human rights while ignoring their opponents' human rights.\n",
